# Berckley Dashboard

A hacker-styled, single-page console for the `extpentest.sh` scanner. It
reads every `pentest_*` directory in the repo root, parses
`report/findings.tsv` and `assets/discovered.log`, and gives you:

- Severity overview with top categories and most-hit scopes
- **Security-posture score** — a 0–100 grade (A–F) for the whole scan, derived
  from the validated severity profile (`100 − (45·C + 18·H + 6·M + 1.5·L)`,
  floored at 0; ≥1 CRITICAL caps the grade at D, ≥1 HIGH at B). Shown as the
  Overview headline and as a section in the exported reports. The model lives in
  `scorecard.py` (single source of truth for dashboard *and* reports).
- **Security-domain classification** — every finding is grouped into one main
  domain (Network, Cryptography/TLS, Web App, Email/DNS, Cloud, Secrets, Access
  Control); shown as Overview cards, Findings filter chips + row badges, and a
  dedicated section in the exported reports. See [CATEGORIES.md](CATEGORIES.md)
  for the full domain → finding-type distribution. The classifier lives in
  `taxonomy.py` (single source of truth for dashboard *and* reports).
- Filterable findings table
- Asset explorer (subdomains, IPs, Azure tenants, GitHub orgs, etc.)
- Live tail of `report/master.log` over Server-Sent Events
- One-click generation of the management + SOC HTML reports
- "New Scan" form that launches `extpentest.sh` inside the container

## Run with Docker

```bash
cd dashboard
docker compose up --build -d
# → http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

The compose file mounts the repo root at `/workspace`, so:

- Existing scans (`../pentest_*`) appear immediately.
- New scans launched from the UI are written back to the host.
- The scanner script (`../extpentest.sh`) and the two report generators
  are executed inside the container.

The Kali base image ships with the bulk of the scanner's CLI tools
(`nmap`, `masscan`, `dig`, `whois`, `curl`, `jq`, `openssl`, `nuclei`).
The scanner gracefully skips anything it can't find on `PATH`, so the
dashboard works even with a partial toolchain.

## Run without Docker (dev mode)

```bash
cd dashboard
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
PENTEST_ROOT=$(realpath ..) \
SCANNER_PATH=$(realpath ../extpentest.sh) \
MGMT_REPORT_PATH=$(realpath ../nw_report_mgmt.sh) \
SOC_REPORT_PATH=$(realpath ../nw_report_soc.sh) \
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload
```
